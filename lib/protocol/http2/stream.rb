		# A single HTTP 2.0 connection can multiplex multiple streams in parallel:
		# multiple requests and responses can be in flight simultaneously and stream
		# data can be interleaved and prioritized.

		# This class encapsulates all of the state, transition, flow-control, and
		# error management as defined by the HTTP 2.0 specification. All you have
		# to do is subscribe to appropriate events (marked with ":" prefix in
		# diagram below) and provide your application logic to handle request
		# and response processing.
